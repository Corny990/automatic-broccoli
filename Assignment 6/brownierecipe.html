                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanila extract</li>
                <li>2/3 cup cocoa</li>
                <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>

            <h3> Instructions

            </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees farenheit. Grease and flour a 9 x 13 inch baking pan. Beat together melted butter, sugar, pumpkin, eggs and vanilla together in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the cocoa, flour, baking soda and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix together until combined. Pour batter into prepared pan. </li>
                <li>To make the cheesecake filling, beat together cream cheese, sugar, egg, vanilla and pumpkin pie spice in a medium bowl. Reserve 2/3 of a cup of this mixture and set it aside now to make the white cheesecake swirl layer.
                </li>
                <li>Mix the pumpkin into the remaining cheesecake mixture. You should have two small bowls of cheesecake batter and pumpkin cheesecake batter. Starting with the white batter, spoon the mixture onto the brownie batter in thin rows. Then do the same with the pumpkin cheesecake batter. Do not worry if they touch or its not perfect. Run a butter knife through the batter in a grid pattern to get the swirled look. Do not over do it.
                </li>
                <li>Bake for 30-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool completely and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before slicing. Makes 24 brownies.</li>
            </ul>
